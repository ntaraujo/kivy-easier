## üìö Intro

Windows Subsystem for Linux is the easiest way to run linux commands without the need to change all your environment. It's becoming more complex and complete. Certainly a good option to kivy developers who want to use buildozer in Windows.
If you don't use WSL yet, [read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## üíªRequirements

* Windows 10 1709 Fall Creators Update 64bit or later.
* Windows Subsystem for Linux feature is enabled.

## üíæInstall

**[For details, please refer to the wiki](https://github.com/ntaraujo/kivy-easier/wiki/Starting)**

#### 1. [Download](https://github.com/ntaraujo/kivy-easier/releases/latest) compressed installer

![](https://badgen.net/badge/size/417MB/?label=expected+size)

#### 2. Extract all files in zip file to same directory
Please extract to a folder that has full access permission.
For example 'Program Files' can not be used.

#### 3. Run Kivy-Easier.exe
It will extract rootfs.tar.gz and register to WSL.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

#### 1. Setup default user
Already has an user created, its name is `kivy`, as the password.
In the folder you extracted the exe, run:
```
.\Kivy-Easier.exe config --default-user kivy
```
Now, when you open the distro, will be logged in as a non-root user.

Tip: shift + right click in the File Explorer show the option "Open PowerShell window here"

#### 2. Open the WSL Terminal
If you use Windows Terminal, will appear the Kivy-Easier option to you in the "ÀÖ";

If you don't, run Kivy-Easier.exe once more, now it wont setup, but open the distro.

You can also create shortcuts with the context menu. Just right click and choose the better option to you.

#### 3. Configure adb, if needed
For WSL2 users, adb doesn't work directly. Kivy Easier proposes a workaround for it.

If asked, confirm you want to run this workaround and if ip and port are right typing "y".

Then, allow to run adb from within wsl in the firewall dialog box.

If you are a WL1 user, this message shouldn't appear.

## üìùHow-to-Use

**[For details, please refer to the wiki](https://github.com/ntaraujo/kivy-easier/wiki/Using)*

#### 1. Access your project directory
Change the current directory to which the `main.py` file is located. If it is in "C:/Users/You/Documents/KivyProject":
```
cd /mnt/c/Users/You/Documents/KivyProject
```

#### 2. Create buildozer.spec file
Your app's specifications will be inside this. Run:
```
buildozer init
```

#### 3. Change it
Open buildozer.spec in your favorite editor (Windows side), change and save.
If you have to edit it inside WSL, install the necessary:
```
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate
sudo pacman -S vim
```
PS, the password is ```kivy```.

#### 5. Start packaging
```
buildozer -v android debug
```
The process is commonly boring, get a coffe.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏èUpdate

#### 1. [Download](https://github.com/ntaraujo/kivy-easier/releases/latest) compressed installer

#### 2. Extract .exe and rootfs.tar.gz from .zip and overwrites existing ones.
