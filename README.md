Thanks HashLDash for the amazing content of your channel!

Some things: The graphical interface is xfce and the virtual box guest additions is installed.

You may want to change the settings of the VM as it is configured to the minimum necessary.

Hostname: Kivy

User: kivy

Password: kivy

Root password: kivy

If after the login the screen goes black, put the vm in full screen.

The keyboard may be unconfigured, use setxkbmap or change the settings manually.

A little work is needed to use the shared folders as a non-root user.

If you ask, I can make a lightner version, maybe without gui.

Any problems or suggestions, feel free to comment!
