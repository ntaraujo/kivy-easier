## Some things

The graphical interface is xfce and the virtual box guest additions is installed.

You may want to change the settings of the VM as it is configured to the minimum necessary.

**Hostname**: Kivy

**User**: kivy

**Password**: kivy

**Root password**: kivy

If after the login the screen goes black, put the vm in full screen.

The keyboard may be unconfigured, use setxkbmap or change the settings manually.

A little work is needed to use the shared folders as a non-root user.

I made this a long time ago, sorry for don't document it very well, time is the trouble.

If you ask, I can update this or make a lightner version, maybe without gui, maybe lightner.

I'm also thinking in try some things like make a distro, to download in a .iso format.

Any problems or suggestions, feel free to comment!
